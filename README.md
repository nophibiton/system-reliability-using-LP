# system-reliability-using-LP
These Matlab scripts are used to demonstrate the use of cvx (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) in solving the system reliability bounds of a structure. The bounds are computed by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. 

All the examples can be found from the study of: Song, J., & Kiureghian, A. der. (2003). Bounds on System Reliability by Linear Programming. Journal of Engineering Mechanics, 129(6), 627â€“636. https://doi.org/10.1061/~ASCE!0733-9399~2003!129:6~627!
